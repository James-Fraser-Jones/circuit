# circuit

This project is a fully-fledged untyped lambda calculus parser, printer and evaluator.

In addition to conventional printing of lambda expressions, 
circuit can generate circuit diagrams that represent the syntactic structure of lambda expressions.

The following image shows the circuit diagrams generated for the lambda expressions produced in the course of evaluating "2 + 3" (represented using church-encoding):
